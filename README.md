 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing financial data for a banking system to generate actionable insights regarding:
‚Ä¢	 Transaction trends
‚Ä¢	Customer spending behavior
‚Ä¢	 Risk assessment
The data flows from raw ingestion to a gold layer star schema, and finally into a Power BI dashboard, via Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse and Warehouse.

Architecture Overview
Importing data into MSSQL-
‚Ä¢	Imported data from three Excel files into a Microsoft SQL Server database in tabular format.

Bronze layer- 
‚Ä¢	Connected on-premises SQL Server to Microsoft Fabric using the On-premises Data Gateway, enabling secure and reliable data transfer without exposing the source directly.
‚Ä¢	Configured the data pipeline to ingest data into the Bronze layer of a Fabric Lakehouse, ensuring the raw data was stored efficiently for further transformation.
‚Ä¢	Utilized OneLake storage to manage the ingested data centrally, setting the stage for building a structured multi-layered data architecture.

 Silver Layer(using pyspark notebook):
‚Ä¢	Cleaned data stored in Delta format tables.
‚Ä¢	Perform operations like Drop duplicates, fill the null values
‚Ä¢	Tables: customer_data, transaction_data, bank_data.

‚≠ê Gold Layer (Star Schema):
        Built using PySpark with the following structure:
       Apply Bussiness logic to transform silver layer data to gold layer (BI consumable data)

Dimension Tables:
‚Ä¢	bankbranch_table: Customer details (Customer_ID, Age, Region, etc.)
‚Ä¢	customer_table: Bank branch financials (Branch_ID, Revenue, Profit, etc.)
‚Ä¢	datedata_table: Date-based hierarchy (Year, Month, Day)
Fact Table:
facttransaction_table: Transactional and investment facts (amounts, types, balances)

üîÑ Gold Layer to Fabric Data Warehouse
To support Power BI connectivity and faster querying, gold layer tables were moved from Lakehouse to Warehouse using Pipeline:

üìä Power BI Reports
Using Fabric's Direct Lake connection, the following insights were visualized:
1. Transaction Trends
‚Ä¢	Monthly volume of transactions
‚Ä¢	Total transaction by customer
2. Customer Spending Behavior
‚Ä¢	Average spending by age group
‚Ä¢	Customer distribution by account type 
3. Risk Assessment
‚Ä¢	Branches with low profit margins
‚Ä¢	Customers with high withdrawals vs balance
‚Ä¢	City and region wise analysis of branch performance
